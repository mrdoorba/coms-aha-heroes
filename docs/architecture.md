## 1. Overview

### What

AHA HEROES is an internal HR web application that replaces the current Google Sheets/Forms + WhatsApp + Zapier workflow for tracking employee achievement points.

### Why

- Current workflow spans Google Sheets, Forms, WhatsApp, and Zapier — fragmented, no access control, no audit trail
- Need data separation between branches (Indonesia and Thailand)
- Need role-based access (Admin, HR, Leader, Employee)
- Need multi-language support (Indonesian, English, Thai)
- Need challenge/appeal system for fairness

### Who

- **All employees** (~100 users initially) — view own points, leaderboard, self-submit achievements
- **Leaders** — nominate employees, approve team self-submissions, challenge submissions
- **HR** — nominate anyone in branch, resolve challenges/appeals, approve redemptions
- **Admin** (developer, 1 person) — full access all branches, manage system settings

### Core Features

- 4 types of achievement points: Poin Bintang sAHAbat, Poin Penalti Staff AHA, Poin AHA, Redeem Poin AHA
- Submit, challenge, appeal, revoke achievement points
- Rewards catalog and redemption system (HR-approved)
- Dashboard with leaderboards (Bintang + Poin AHA, visible to all employees, filterable by team)
- Comment threads on submissions for discussion
- In-app notification system
- Import data from Google Sheets (deferred to Phase 3)
- Export reports to Google Sheets (deferred to Phase 3)
- Multi-language UI (Indonesian, English, Thai)
- Branch-separated data with role-based access
- Mobile-responsive PWA (add to home screen, bottom navigation, offline indicator)

### Point Types — Detailed Specifications

#### 1. Poin Bintang sAHAbat (Positive Recognition)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Purpose** | Recognize positive contributions |
| **Points per submission** | 1 Bintang (fixed) |
| **Impact on Poin AHA** | +10 per Bintang (configurable via system_settings) |
| **Who can give** | Leader (any employee in branch), HR (anyone in branch), Admin (anyone) |
| **Self-submit** | Employee can self-submit → needs Leader approval |
| **Leader self-give** | Not allowed. Leader A can give Leader B. |
| **Screenshot** | Required |

**Submission form fields:**

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| Nama Staff | User selector | Yes | Employee receiving the Bintang |
| Perbuatan | Text | Yes | Format: "[siapa] berkontribusi dalam [apa]" |
| Related staff | Text/user tags | No | All staff involved (documentation only — points go to Nama Staff only) |
| Screenshot | File upload | Yes | Evidence of contribution |

---

#### 2. Poin Penalti Staff AHA (Penalty)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Purpose** | Record rule violations with severity tracking |
| **Points per submission** | 1-10 (variable, based on violation level) |
| **Impact on Poin AHA** | -5 per Penalti point (configurable). E.g., 3 Penalti points = -15 Poin AHA |
| **Who can give** | Leader (any employee in branch), HR (anyone in branch), Admin (anyone) |
| **Self-submit** | Not applicable (penalties are given, not self-reported) |
| **Leader self-give** | Not allowed |
| **Screenshot** | Required |
| **Appeal** | Affected employee can appeal → points FROZEN until HR resolves |

**Submission form fields:**

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| Nama Staff | User selector | Yes | Employee receiving the Penalti |
| Komponen KITTA | Select one | Yes | See KITTA categories below |
| Kejadian | Text | Yes | Format: "[siapa] [apa] sehingga [dampak]" |
| Related staff | Text/user tags | No | All staff involved (documentation only) |
| Tingkat Pelanggaran | Select 1-10 | Yes | = number of Penalti points deducted |
| Screenshot | File upload | Yes | Evidence of violation |

**KITTA Categories** (Komponen penilaian):

| Code | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `K` | Kualitas Hasil | Quality of work output |
| `I` | Inisiatif | Initiative and proactiveness |
| `T1` | Taat Aturan | Rule compliance / SOP adherence |

| 3 | Berdampak terhadap pihak luar | Affects Supplier/Marketplace/Customer |
| 4-5 | Menimbulkan kerugian finansial | Causes financial loss |
| 6-10 | Pelanggaran berat | Severe violations |

**Escalation rules:**
- Multiple violations in one finding = increases violation level
- Repeated major violations may result in ST/SP (Surat Teguran / Surat Peringatan) — handled outside the app for now
- 1 submission = 1 KITTA category (separate submissions for multiple categories)

---

#### 3. Poin AHA (Direct Points)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Purpose** | Reward participation in activities and events |
| **Points per submission** | 1-10 (variable, based on level) |

---

#### 4. Redeem Poin AHA (Spend Points)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Purpose** | Exchange accumulated Poin AHA for rewards |
| **Minimum balance** | None — just enough to cover reward cost |
| **Who can request** | Any employee, leader |
| **Approval** | HR approves each redemption |
| **Screenshot** | Not required |

**Redemption form fields:**

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| Nama Staff | User selector | Yes | Shows current Poin AHA balance |
| Hadiah | Select from catalog | Yes | Rewards + costs from Google Sheets data (Phase 1: seeded manually) |
| Keterangan | Text | No | Additional notes (e.g., size for kaos/seragam AHA) |

**Rewards catalog:** Managed by HR. Data sourced from Google Sheets. Examples: power bank, mug, sticker, kaos/seragam AHA, vacation, etc. Each reward has a point cost.

---

#### Poin AHA Balance Calculation

```
Poin AHA Balance = direct_poin_aha
                 + (bintang_count × bintang_point_impact)
                 - (penalti_points_sum × penalti_point_impact)
                 - redeemed_total
```

Where:
- `direct_poin_aha` = sum of all active Poin AHA awards (each 1-10 based on level)
- `bintang_count` = number of active Bintang awards (each always = 1)
- `bintang_point_impact` = 10 (configurable in system_settings)
- `penalti_points_sum` = sum of all active Penalti points (each 1-10 based on violation level)
- `penalti_point_impact` = 5 (configurable in system_settings)
- `redeemed_total` = sum of approved redemption costs
- Penalti at 'frozen' status (under appeal) are **excluded** from the calculation
- Changing impact values is **retroactive** — affects all historical balances

**Example:** Employee has 3 Bintang, 1 Penalti (level 2), 2 direct Poin AHA (level 5 + level 3), redeemed 20 points:
```
Balance = (5 + 3) + (3 × 10) - (2 × 5) - 20 = 8 + 30 - 10 - 20 = 8
```

### Constraints

- All infrastructure on GCP (single billing)
- ~100 users initially, design for scalability
- Mobile-first design — most employees will use smartphones
- Google Sheets integration deferred (not a launch blocker)

## 2. Tech Stack

### Frontend

| Technology | Version | Purpose | Chosen Over |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **TanStack Start** | v1 (Vite + TanStack Router) | Full-stack React framework, SSR, streaming, type-safe routing + search params, lighter runtime than Next.js | Next.js (heavier runtime, Vercel-coupled), Nuxt (smaller ecosystem) |
| **TypeScript** | 6.0 | Type safety across the stack (last JS-based release before Go-based TS 7) | JavaScript |
| **Tailwind CSS** | 4.2 | Utility-first styling, CSS variables, logical properties for RTL-readiness | Chakra UI (runtime CSS-in-JS), MUI (heavy bundle) |
| **shadcn/ui** | latest | Accessible component primitives (Radix-based), you own the code | Ant Design (massive bundle), Headless UI (fewer components) |
| **Paraglide JS** | latest | i18n with official TanStack Start support — compile-time typed functions, ~2KB bundle, built-in locale routing + SSR middleware, ICU via plugin | next-intl (Next.js-specific), i18next (22KB, runtime parsing), Lingui (no built-in routing) |
| **TanStack Table** | v8 | Headless, type-safe data tables with sorting, filtering, pagination | AG Grid (paid license), MUI DataGrid (MUI lock-in) |
| **TanStack Query** | v5 | Server state management, caching, background refetching | SWR (less features), raw fetch |
| **Zustand** | latest | Minimal client-side global state (theme, sidebar) | Redux (boilerplate), Jotai (overkill for this scope) |
| **Recharts** | v2 | Composable charting library (line, bar, pie, donut) built on D3 + React. Used for Reports Dashboard | Chart.js (imperative API), Nivo (heavier), Victory (less maintained) |

### Backend

| Technology | Version | Purpose | Chosen Over |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Hono** | >=4.12.4 | Ultra-lightweight API framework (14KB), Web Standards, middleware-first. Embedded in TanStack Start via API wildcard route (`/api/$`). Pin >=4.12.4 to avoid CVE-2026-29045 (serveStatic auth bypass) | Express (legacy), FastAPI (two-language stack), NestJS (heavy), TanStack Start server functions alone (no streaming uploads, no OpenAPI, no external API testing) |
| **TypeScript** | 6.0 | Same language as frontend = shared types, schemas, constants | Python (no shared types with frontend) |
| **Drizzle ORM** | 0.45.x | Type-safe SQL, zero-overhead (compiles to raw SQL), PostgreSQL-native. Pin to stable 0.45.x — v1.0 beta has breaking changes | Prisma (query engine binary, slower cold starts), SQLAlchemy (different language) |
| **Resend** | latest | Transactional email (auth only: password reset, future invites). Free tier: 100 emails/day | SendGrid (overkill), SES (complex setup) |
| **Zod** | latest | Runtime validation + static type inference, shared with frontend | Joi (no TS inference), Pydantic (Python only) |
| **Hono RPC** | latest | End-to-end type safety between backend routes and frontend client. TanStack Start server functions used selectively for SSR loaders and simple component-colocated mutations | tRPC (heavier), GraphQL (overkill for CRUD-heavy app), OpenAPI codegen (extra step) |
| **Better Auth** | >=1.5.6 | Self-hosted auth with built-in RBAC plugin, sessions in your DB. v1.5 adds `dash()` plugin for auth-specific audit logs (sign-ups, sign-ins, password changes) — complements but does not replace our custom `audit_logs` table for business events. TanStack Start integration via `tanstackStartCookies` plugin (must be last plugin). Auth checks via `beforeLoad` route guards + server function middleware (cache sessions with TanStack Query `staleTime` to avoid per-navigation round-trips) | NextAuth (limited RBAC), Firebase Auth (weak RBAC, vendor lock), Clerk (SaaS cost) |

### Database

| Technology | Purpose | Chosen Over |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **PostgreSQL 18** | Primary database — RLS for multi-tenancy, JSONB for flexible metadata, pgvector-ready for future AI | MySQL (no RLS), Firestore (no SQL/joins), MongoDB (no relational integrity) |

### Infrastructure

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Vite** | Build tooling (bundled with TanStack Start). Tailwind CSS via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin |
| **OpenTofu** | Infrastructure as Code for all GCP resources (open source Terraform fork, state encryption via GCP KMS) |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD pipeline |
| **Docker** | Containerization for Cloud Run deployments |
| **bun** | Package management (bun as package manager, Node as runtime) |

### PWA & Mobile

- **Manual PWA setup** — `vite-plugin-pwa` is incompatible with TanStack Start production builds (TanStack/router#4988, vite-pwa PR #786 unmerged). Using manual approach instead:
  - Static `public/manifest.webmanifest` (hand-written)
  - Post-build Workbox script (`workbox-build` `injectManifest`) for service worker generation
  - `useOnlineStatus` hook for offline indicator (pure React, uses `navigator.onLine`)
- Bottom navigation on mobile (leaderboard, points, notifications, profile)
- Offline indicator (not full offline mode — just shows "you're offline")
- Touch-friendly UI: larger tap targets, proper spacing, swipe gestures where appropriate
- Responsive breakpoints: mobile-first design, optimized for smartphones used by field employees
- No native app — PWA covers the use case without app store overhead
- **Note:** When `vite-plugin-pwa` merges Environment API support, migrate from manual approach to plugin

### Notifications

- In-app only (no email for notifications)
- Notification bell + unread count in header
- Backed by `notifications` database table
- **Delivery mechanism:** Polling via TanStack Query (`refetchInterval: 30000` — every 30s). SSE/WebSocket not justified for ~100 users. The unread count query (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notifications WHERE user_id = $1 AND is_read = false`) is indexed and fast.

### Transactional Email (Auth Only)

- **Resend** (free tier: 100 emails/day) — used only for auth transactional emails:
  - Password reset links
  - (Future) Account invite emails
- Not used for notifications — those remain in-app only
- Resend API key stored in Secret Manager

## 6. Database Design

### Multi-Tenancy Strategy

**Shared Database + Row-Level Security (RLS)**

- Single PostgreSQL database with `branch_id` column on every tenant-scoped table
- PostgreSQL RLS enforces data isolation at the database level
- Even if application code has a bug, data cannot leak across branches
- Admin can query across branches; HR, Leaders, and Employees are restricted to their own branch

### Schema

```sql

-- ============================================================
-- DESIGN NOTES
-- ============================================================
-- 1. audit_logs.actor_id safety:
--    Always snapshot actor info (name, email, role) inside old_value/new_value
--    JSONB so the audit log remains self-contained if a user is later renamed
--    or archived.
--
-- 2. point_categories are global (no branch_id). All branches share the same
--    3 point types (BINTANG, PENALTI, POIN_AHA). REDEEM is not a category —
--    redemptions use the separate `redemptions` table.
--    Point impact values live in system_settings only (single source of truth).
--
-- 3. Soft delete / archive:
--    - Users: archived_at TIMESTAMPTZ set when employee leaves. Keep history,
--      remove from active views, auto-reject pending submissions.
--    - Achievement points: never physically deleted. Use 'revoked' status.
--    - Rewards: soft-delete via is_active = false.
--
-- 4. Challenges vs Appeals:
--    Separate tables because different authorization rules.
--    Challenge: Leaders only, Penalti submissions only. A Leader disputes
--    a Penalti given to someone (e.g., disagrees with the penalty).
--    Appeal: The penalized Employee only, on their own Penalti.
--    Bintang and Poin AHA cannot be challenged or appealed.
--    Both resolved by HR via comment threads.
--
-- 5. Point balance calculation (Poin AHA):
--    poin_aha_balance = direct_poin_aha
--                     + (bintang_count × system_settings['bintang_point_impact'])
--                     - (penalti_points_sum × system_settings['penalti_point_impact'])
--                     - redeemed_total
--    - Bintang: always 1 per submission, so bintang_count × 10 (default) = AHA impact
--    - Penalti: 1-10 points per submission (variable severity), so SUM × 5 (default) = AHA deduction
--    - Direct Poin AHA: 1-10 per submission (level), summed directly
--    Impact values are read from system_settings at query time.
--    Changing the value retroactively affects all historical balances (by design).
--
-- 6. Cross-branch nominations:
--    Currently disabled at app level. Schema supports it (branch_id on
--    achievement_points is the recipient's branch). To enable cross-branch,
--    relax the app-level restriction — no schema change needed.
--
-- 7. Polymorphic comments (entity_type + entity_id):
--    No DB-level FK on entity_id. Application code validates that entity_type
--    + entity_id reference a valid record. Simpler than 3 separate join tables.

## 6b. File Upload Architecture

Screenshots are required for Bintang and Penalti submissions, optional for Poin AHA. All uploads go to the `coms-aha-heroes-uploads` Cloud Storage bucket.

### Upload Flow

```
Client (browser)
  │
  ├── 1. POST /api/v1/uploads/signed-url   → API generates signed upload URL
  │       { filename, contentType }          (valid 15 min, max 5MB)
  │
  ├── 2. PUT <signed-url>                   → Client uploads directly to Cloud Storage
  │       (bypasses Cloud Run — no bandwidth cost)
  │
  └── 3. POST /api/v1/points               → Submit achievement with screenshot_url
          { ..., screenshot_url }
```

### Constraints

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Max file size** | 5MB |
| **Accepted MIME types** | `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp` |
| **Client-side resize** | Max 1920px width before upload (reduces storage, speeds loading) |
| **Bucket access** | Private (uniform bucket-level access, no public URLs) |
| **Serving method** | Short-lived signed URLs (15 min expiry) generated on demand |
| **Path format** | `uploads/{branch_id}/{year}/{month}/{uuid}.{ext}` |

### Security

- Bucket is **not public** — all access via signed URLs
- Signed upload URLs are scoped to specific object path and content type
- Signed read URLs expire after 15 minutes — even if shared, they stop working
- No virus scanning needed (images only, rendered in `<img>` tags, not executed)

### Orphaned Upload Cleanup

Users may upload a file via signed URL but never submit the form. These orphaned objects accumulate in Cloud Storage.

- **Policy:** Cloud Storage lifecycle rule deletes objects in `uploads/` older than 7 days that are not referenced by any `achievement_points.screenshot_url`
- **Implementation:** Cloud Scheduler job (weekly) runs a cleanup function that lists objects > 7 days old and checks for matching `screenshot_url` rows. Unreferenced objects are deleted.
- **Alternative (simpler, acceptable at this scale):** Accept the small storage cost (~$0.02/GB/month) and skip cleanup until it becomes measurable. The lifecycle rule can be added later via OpenTofu without code changes.
- **Phase 1:** Accept orphans (no cleanup). Revisit if storage exceeds 1GB.

## 7. Authentication & Authorization

### Auth Provider: Better Auth

- Self-hosted — all session data stored in our PostgreSQL
- Built-in RBAC plugin for role management
- Phase 1: email/password only
- Phase 3: add Google OAuth
- TypeScript-native, runs on any runtime

### Session Configuration

```typescript
session: {
  expiresIn: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // 7 days
  updateAge: 60 * 60 * 24,      // refresh daily on activity
}
```

- **7-day sliding window** — active users stay logged in indefinitely
- **Inactive for > 7 days** — must re-authenticate (e.g., returning from vacation)
- Practical for an internal tool used daily by ~100 employees

### Account Creation & Management

**Account creation** is admin/HR-only — no self-registration.

```
HR/Admin creates user via POST /users
  │
  ├── 1. Backend creates Better Auth account (email + temp password)
  ├── 2. Backend creates `users` row (branch, team, role, department, etc.)
  │      Same UUID used for both (linked by ID)
  ├── 3. User record marked `must_change_password = true`
  │
  └── Employee logs in with temp password
       │
       └── Middleware detects `must_change_password = true`
            → Redirects to "Set your password" screen
            → After password change, `must_change_password = false`
            → Normal app access
```

**Bulk import:** Phase 3 Google Sheets import includes employee list import (name, email, branch, team, role). System generates temp passwords and creates accounts in batch.

**Password reset:** Better Auth's built-in `forgetPassword` plugin + Resend (free tier) for sending reset emails. Flow:
1. Employee clicks "Forgot password" on login page
2. `POST /auth/forgot-password` → Better Auth sends reset link via Resend
3. Employee clicks link → `POST /auth/reset-password` with token + new password

**Account archiving:** `POST /users/:id/archive` sets `archived_at`, auto-rejects pending submissions, and deactivates the Better Auth account (prevents login).

### Roles

| Role | Who | Scope | Description |
|------|-----|-------|-------------|
| `admin` | Developer (1 person) | All branches | Full system access, manage system settings, branches, categories |
| `hr` | HR department | Own branch | Nominate anyone in branch, resolve challenges/appeals, approve redemptions, manage rewards catalog, can be challenged |
| `leader` | Team leads | Own branch (team-scoped for approvals) | Nominate any employee in branch, approve own team's self-submissions, challenge Penalti submissions (Leaders only), see all detailed points |
| `employee` | Staff | Own data + leaderboard | View own points, self-submit (needs Leader approval), appeal penalties, challenge submissions, request redemptions |

### Authorization Matrix

| Action | Admin | HR | Leader | Employee |
|--------|-------|-----|--------|----------|
| View all branches | Yes | No | No | No |
| View own branch users | Yes | Yes | Yes | Leaderboard only |
| View all detailed points | Yes | Yes | Yes | Own only |
| View leaderboard (Bintang + Poin AHA) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Submit Bintang/Penalti/Poin AHA | Yes | Yes (any in branch) | Yes (any in branch) | Self only (pending) |
| Approve employee self-submissions | Yes | Yes | Own team only | No |
| Challenge a Penalti | Yes | No | Yes (Penalti only) | No |
| Appeal a Penalti | No | No | No | Own penalties only |
| Resolve challenges/appeals | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Revoke points | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Request redemption | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Approve redemptions | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Manage rewards catalog | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Manage users | Yes | Yes (own branch) | No | No |
| Manage teams | Yes | Yes (own branch) | No | No |
| View audit log | Yes | Yes (own branch) | No | No |
| Manage system settings | Yes | No | No | No |
| Manage categories | Yes | No | No | No |
| Manage branches | Yes | No | No | No |
| Import/export sheets | Yes | Yes (own branch) | No | No |
| Add comments | Yes | Yes | Yes | On own submissions/challenges/appeals |

### Middleware Chain

```
Request
  │
  ├── 1. authMiddleware()       → Verify session (Better Auth)
  ├── 2. branchMiddleware()     → Resolve user's branch context
  ├── 3. teamMiddleware()       → Resolve user's team (for leader scoping)
  ├── 4. rbacMiddleware()       → Check role + branch + team permissions
  └── 5. SET LOCAL app.* vars   → PostgreSQL RLS session variables
                                   (app.current_user_id, app.current_branch_id,
                                    app.current_role, app.current_team_id)
```

> **Important:** All RLS session variables MUST use `SET LOCAL` within a transaction (not `SET`). `SET LOCAL` scopes variables to the current transaction only, preventing variable leakage across pooled connections. Each request wraps its database operations in a transaction where `SET LOCAL` is called first.

## 8. API Design

### Approach: REST + Hono RPC

RESTful resource naming with Hono RPC client for end-to-end TypeScript type safety. No code generation needed.

### Endpoints

```
Base URL: /api/v1

# Authentication
POST   /auth/login                   (email/password)
POST   /auth/logout
POST   /auth/refresh
GET    /auth/me
POST   /auth/change-password         { currentPassword, newPassword } (clears must_change_password)
POST   /auth/forgot-password         { email } (sends reset link via Resend)
POST   /auth/reset-password          { token, newPassword }
POST   /auth/google                  (Google OAuth — Phase 3)

# Users (hr/admin)
GET    /users                        ?branch_id=&team_id=&department=&is_active=&page=&limit=

POST   /users
PATCH  /users/:id
POST   /users/:id/archive            (soft archive — keep history, auto-reject pending)

GET    /teams                        ?branch_id=
GET    /teams/:id
POST   /teams

## 9. Internationalization (i18n)

### Three-Layer Approach

#### Layer 1 — UI Strings (Paraglide JS)

Paraglide JS message files per locale:

```
src/paraglide/
  ├── messages/
  │   ├── en.json    # English (default fallback)
  │   ├── id.json    # Bahasa Indonesia
  │   └── th.json    # Thai
  └── runtime.js     # Generated — compile-time typed message functions
```

Typed message functions (compile-time, ~2KB bundle):

```typescript
import * as m from "@/paraglide/messages"

m.dashboard_totalPoints()    // "Total Points"
m.points_status_pending()    // "Pending"
m.points_period({ quarter: 1, year: 2026 }) // "Period: Q1 2026"
```

#### Layer 2 — Database Content (translation tables)

Entities like `point_categories` have companion `_translations` tables. API returns the translation matching the user's locale, with English fallback.

#### Layer 3 — Date/Number/Currency Formatting

Use built-in `Intl` API (zero-dependency):

- `Intl.DateTimeFormat(locale)` for dates
- `Intl.NumberFormat(locale)` for numbers

#### Locale Routing

**Cookie-based** (no URL prefix like `/en/dashboard`). Internal tool — SEO is irrelevant.

- Paraglide middleware reads locale from cookie on each request
- Cookie is set from `users.locale_pref` on login and updated when user changes language
- No locale segment in route paths — simpler route definitions

#### Locale Resolution Order

1. Cookie value (set from `users.locale_pref` on login)
2. Browser `Accept-Language` header (first visit before login)
3. Branch default locale
4. Fallback: `en`

#### Adding New Languages

1. Add a new JSON file in `src/paraglide/messages/` (e.g., `ja.json`)
2. Add translation rows in `_translations` tables
3. Add locale to Paraglide config in `project.inlang/settings.json`
4. Done — no code changes needed

#### RTL Preparedness

- Use CSS logical properties (`margin-inline-start` vs `margin-left`)
- Tailwind CSS 4 supports logical properties natively
- `dir` attribute support in layout component
- Zero cost now, ready if needed later

## 10. Google Sheets Integration

### Authentication

GCP Service Account with domain-wide delegation:

1. Create service account in GCP project
2. Enable Google Sheets API v4 + Google Drive API
3. Share target spreadsheets with service account email
4. Store service account key in Secret Manager

### Import Flow (Google Sheets → DB)

```
Admin UI (select sheet, map columns)
    │
    ▼
Sheets Service
    ├── 1. Read sheet data via Sheets API v4
    ├── 2. Map columns using admin-defined mapping
    ├── 3. Validate each row with Zod schemas
    ├── 4. Separate valid / invalid rows
    ├── 5. Upsert valid rows in a DB transaction
    └── 6. Update sync job status + error report
```

### Export Flow (DB → Google Sheets)

```
Admin UI (select report type, period, branch)
    │
    ▼
Sheets Service
    ├── 1. Query data based on report type + filters
    ├── 2. Format as array-of-arrays for Sheets API
    ├── 3. Create new sheet or update existing
    ├── 4. Write data via Sheets API v4
    └── 5. Apply formatting (headers, column widths)
```

### Scheduled Exports

Cloud Scheduler triggers periodic exports (e.g., weekly/quarterly reports) to predefined Google Sheets.

## 11. Infrastructure as Code (OpenTofu)

### Structure

```

│       └── terraform.tfvars
├── backend.tf                  # GCS remote state
└── versions.tf
```

### Remote State

```hcl
terraform {  # OpenTofu uses the same HCL syntax and block names
  backend "gcs" {
    bucket = "coms-aha-heroes-tfstate"
    prefix = "tofu/state"
  }
}
```

### Local Development

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:18
    ports: ["5432:5432"]
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: coms_aha_heroes_dev
      POSTGRES_USER: dev
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: dev
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  pgdata:
```

- `bun run dev` starts TanStack Start dev server (Vite) on `localhost:3000`
- `docker compose up -d` starts local PostgreSQL
- `bun run db:migrate` runs Drizzle migrations against local DB
- `bun run db:seed` populates dev data (see Seed Data Strategy below)

### Seed Data Strategy

```
src/db/seed/
├── base.ts          # Branches, point_categories, system_settings (all environments)
├── dev.ts           # Fake users (all 4 roles), sample points, challenges, rewards
└── index.ts         # Entry point — runs base + env-specific seed
```

| Environment | Seed Script | Data |
|-------------|------------|------|
| **dev** | `base.ts` + `dev.ts` | 2 branches, 4 teams, 20 users (admin/hr/leader/employee), 50 sample points, 5 rewards |
| **staging** | `base.ts` + `dev.ts` | Same as dev (safe to test with fake data) |
| **production** | `base.ts` only | 2 branches (ID, TH), 3 point_categories, system_settings defaults. Users created by HR via UI. |

### Environment Strategy

```
Cloud SQL Instance: coms-aha-heroes-db
  ├── Database: coms_aha_heroes_production    ← production traffic
  └── Database: coms_aha_heroes_staging       ← staging tagged URL (zero extra cost)
```

| Environment | Database | Cloud Run | URL | Purpose |
|------------|----------|-----------|-----|---------|
| `dev` | Local Docker PostgreSQL | `bun run dev` | localhost:3000 | Local development |
| `staging` | Cloud SQL → `coms_aha_heroes_staging` | Cloud Run revision (0% traffic, tagged "staging") | `staging---coms-aha-heroes-app-xxxxx.run.app` | Test new features safely — only accessible via tagged URL |
| `production` | Cloud SQL → `coms_aha_heroes_production` | Cloud Run revision (100% traffic) | `coms-aha-heroes-app-xxxxx.run.app` | Live users |

**Key: staging and production use separate databases on the same Cloud SQL instance.** New code cannot corrupt production data during testing.

> **Deployment detail:** Staging and production are two separate Cloud Run revisions
> deployed from the same Docker image but with **different environment variables**
> (primarily `DATABASE_URL`). The staging revision is deployed first with
> `DATABASE_URL` pointing to `coms_aha_heroes_staging`. After approval, a second
> `gcloud run deploy` creates the production revision with `DATABASE_URL` pointing
> to `coms_aha_heroes_production`. They are independent revisions, not one revision
> connecting to two databases.

### Cloud SQL Built-In Safety Nets

| Feature | What It Does | Cost |
|---------|-------------|------|
| Automated daily backups | Full backup every day, retained 7 days | Included |
| Point-in-time recovery | Restore to any second in the last 7 days | Included |
| On-demand backup | Snapshot before risky deploys | Included |

---

## 12. CI/CD Pipeline

### Zero-Downtime Deployment Strategy

Users are never disturbed by new deployments. New code is deployed as a Cloud Run revision with **0% traffic** and a "staging" tag. The team tests via the tagged URL. Only after approval does traffic shift 100% to the new revision.

```

## 13. Future AI Integration

### Preparation Already in Architecture

| What | How It Enables AI |
|------|-------------------|
| PostgreSQL (not Firestore) | Can add `pgvector` extension without migrating |
| `metadata JSONB` column | Store AI tags, classification scores without schema change |
| `audit_logs` table | Training data for approval pattern learning |
| Hono middleware chain | Insert AI middleware (auto-classify) without changing routes |
| Project structure | Add separate `ai-worker/` Cloud Run service when needed |
| GCP hosting | Vertex AI is native, same VPC, no cross-cloud networking |

### Planned AI Features (Phase 4)

1. **Auto-categorization** — Suggest category for new achievement submissions using LLM
2. **Achievement recommendations** — "Employees similar to you also earned..." via pgvector embeddings
3. **Trend analysis** — Department performance patterns, seasonal trends, anomaly detection
4. **Smart approval suggestions** — Learn from past approval/rejection patterns

### Implementation Path

1. Add `pgvector` extension to Cloud SQL
2. Create `apps/ai-worker/` Cloud Run service
3. Generate embeddings for achievement descriptions via Vertex AI
4. Store in `achievement_embeddings` table
5. Use cosine similarity for recommendation queries

---

## 14. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

| Week | Deliverables |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Project setup (TanStack Start + Hono + Drizzle + docker-compose), **integration spike** (auth + one protected route + Hono API + Paraglide locale switch — validates stack compatibility), OpenTofu infra provisioning, Cloud SQL + Drizzle schema (all tables), CI/CD pipeline, PWA manifest + service worker, seed scripts (base + dev) |
| 2 | Better Auth integration (email/password), RBAC middleware for 4 roles (admin/hr/leader/employee), branch guard, team middleware, RLS policies for all tables |
| 3 | Users CRUD, Teams CRUD, Point Categories setup (4 types seeded), Achievement Points submission (immediate-active for leader/hr, pending for employee self-submit) |
| 4 | Leader approval of self-submissions, basic leaderboard (Bintang + Poin AHA, filterable by team), mobile-responsive layout with bottom navigation, deploy to Cloud Run staging |

**Exit Criteria:** HR/Leader can submit points (immediately active). Employee can self-submit (pending until Leader approves). Leaderboard shows Bintang and Poin AHA rankings. App works on mobile (PWA installable).

### Phase 2 — Core Features (Weeks 5-8)

| Week | Deliverables |
|------|-------------|
| 5 | Challenge system (file with reason, HR resolve), Appeal system for Penalti (employee appeals, points frozen, HR resolve), comment threads on submissions/challenges/appeals |
| 6 | Rewards catalog CRUD (HR manages), Redemption request + HR approval flow, Poin AHA balance calculation (direct + Bintang impact - Penalti impact - redeemed) |
| 7 | In-app notification system (submission received, challenge/appeal filed, resolved, redemption approved/rejected), notification bell + list UI |
| 8 | i18n implementation (ID, EN, TH), locale switching, date/number formatting, admin settings page (configurable point impact values), production deployment |

**Exit Criteria:** Full challenge/appeal workflow working. Rewards and redemptions operational. In-app notifications functional. App works in 3 languages.

### Phase 3 — Polish & Scale (Weeks 9-12)

| Week | Deliverables |
|------|-------------|
| 9 | Google Sheets import (historical data migration), column mapping UI, validation + error reporting |
| 10 | Google Sheets export, audit log viewer, advanced filtering/search, bulk operations (hr/admin), Google OAuth login |
| 11 | Performance optimization, monitoring setup, load testing, mobile UX polish (touch targets, swipe gestures, offline indicator) |
| 12 | UAT, documentation, training materials, production go-live |

**Exit Criteria:** App in production use by both branches. Historical data migrated. Google Sheets workflow fully replaced.

### Phase 4 — AI Features (Weeks 13-16, optional)

| Week | Deliverables |
|------|-------------|
| 13 | pgvector setup, embedding pipeline |
| 14 | Auto-categorization suggestions |
| 15 | Trend analysis dashboard |
| 16 | Recommendation engine, anomaly detection |

## 15. Decision Log

| # | Decision | Chosen | Rejected | Rationale |
|---|----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Frontend framework | TanStack Start v1 | Next.js 16, Nuxt | TanStack Start now stable v1 with official Paraglide i18n + shadcn/ui support; type-safe routing + search params; lighter runtime; Hono embedded via API wildcard route. Previously chose Next.js when Start was beta — revisited 2026-03-26 |
| 2 | Backend framework | Hono (TypeScript) | FastAPI (Python), Express, NestJS | Shared language with frontend = shared types/schemas; fastest cold starts on Cloud Run; Hono RPC for e2e type safety |
| 3 | Database | PostgreSQL 18 | MySQL, Firestore, MongoDB | RLS for multi-tenancy, pgvector for future AI, JSONB for flexible metadata, strongest SQL features |
| 4 | Multi-tenancy | Shared DB + RLS | Separate DBs, Schema-per-tenant | 2 branches doesn't justify operational complexity; RLS enforces isolation at DB level |
| 5 | Auth | Better Auth | NextAuth, Firebase Auth, Clerk | Self-hosted (data in own DB), TypeScript-native RBAC, no SaaS cost, stays within GCP |
| 6 | ORM | Drizzle | Prisma, TypeORM, SQLAlchemy | No binary engine (fast cold starts), SQL-level control, type-safe without codegen |
| 7 | Hosting | Cloud Run (single service) | GKE, App Engine, Compute Engine, Firebase Hosting | Scale-to-zero = cheapest for 100 users; simplest ops; no K8s overhead; single service sufficient at this scale |
| 8 | i18n | Paraglide JS | next-intl, i18next, Lingui, typesafe-i18n | Official TanStack Start integration with built-in locale routing + SSR middleware; compile-time typed functions (~2KB vs i18next 22KB); ICU via plugin. Previously chose next-intl (Next.js-specific) — revisited 2026-03-26 |
| 9 | API style | REST + Hono RPC | GraphQL, tRPC | REST is simpler for CRUD-heavy app; Hono RPC gives type safety without GraphQL complexity |
| 10 | IaC | OpenTofu | Terraform (BSL license), Pulumi, gcloud CLI scripts | Fully open source (MPL 2.0), same HCL syntax as Terraform, built-in state encryption via GCP KMS, Linux Foundation governance |
| 11 | Project structure | Single TanStack Start project | Turborepo monorepo, separate repos | Single service = no need for monorepo tooling; simpler DX; split later if needed |
| 12 | GCP region | asia-southeast1 (Jakarta) | asia-southeast2 (Singapore) | Majority of users in Indonesia; acceptable latency (~30-40ms) to Thailand |
| 13 | Role system | 4 roles (admin, hr, leader, employee) | 3 roles (super_admin, admin, employee) | Need distinct Leader (team-scoped approval) and HR (branch-scoped resolution) roles; admin is developer-only |
| 14 | Point activation | Immediate-active (Leader/HR submit) | Approval-first | Reduces friction; challenges/appeals handle disputes after the fact |
| 15 | Challenge/Appeal model | Separate tables | Single dispute table | Different authorization rules (anyone can challenge, only penalized employee can appeal); clearer data model |
| 16 | Notifications | In-app only | Email (SendGrid/Resend) | ~100 users, all internal; email adds cost and complexity with no clear benefit at this scale |
| 17 | Point periods | No periods (open-ended) | Quarterly periods | Business decided periods never close; simplifies schema and queries |
| 18 | Redemptions | HR-approved, no inventory | Auto-approve, with inventory | Small scale; HR wants manual control over reward fulfillment |
| 19 | Cross-branch nominations | Disabled (schema supports future) | Enabled now | Not needed yet; branch_id on achievement_points allows future cross-branch if needed |
| 20 | Employee departure | Archive (keep history) | Hard delete | Audit trail and historical leaderboard integrity require keeping data |
| 21 | Point impact values | Configurable via system_settings | Hardcoded | Business wants flexibility to change +10/-5 values without code deploy |
| 22 | Leaderboard visibility | All employees (Bintang + Poin AHA only) | Leaders/HR only | Transparency motivates employees; hide Penalti to avoid public shaming |
| 23 | Comment system | Polymorphic (entity_type + entity_id) | Separate tables per entity | Fewer tables, simpler queries, same authorization pattern for all comment contexts |
| 24 | Mobile experience | PWA + responsive design | Native app, responsive-only | PWA gives add-to-home-screen + offline indicator without app store overhead; Tailwind + shadcn already mobile-friendly |
| 25 | Point impact retroactivity | Retroactive (query-time calculation) | Snapshot at award time | Simpler: balance always = f(system_settings, counts). Changing impact value updates all balances instantly. |
| 26 | Reward catalog i18n | No translation tables | reward_translations table | Rewards data from Google Sheets; Thailand branch not yet established — add later if needed |
| 27 | Leader self-submission | Not allowed | Allowed (HR approves) | Leaders cannot give themselves points. Leader A can give Leader B. HR can give anyone. |
| 28 | Multiple challengers | Allowed | One challenge per submission | Multiple people can challenge the same point; HR resolves once for all challengers |
| 29 | Notification retention | 90-day auto-cleanup for read | Keep forever, manual cleanup | Prevents table bloat; 90 days sufficient for historical reference |
| 30 | Production DB tier | db-f1-micro (shared vCPU, 614MB) | db-custom-1-3840 | Sufficient for ~100 users; lowest cost; upgrade later if needed |
| 31 | File upload method | Signed URLs to Cloud Storage | Proxy through Cloud Run | Direct upload avoids bandwidth cost on Cloud Run; signed URLs keep bucket private |
| 32 | Session duration | 7-day sliding window | 8-hour fixed, 30-day default | 8h forces daily login (annoying); 30d too long for HR data; 7d sliding = practical balance |
| 33 | Rewards branch scope | Nullable branch_id on rewards | Global-only rewards | Thailand may need different catalog/pricing; nullable = global by default, branch-specific when needed |
| 34 | Orphaned pending submissions | Escalate to HR | Auto-reassign to new leader, reject | HR already has branch-wide approval; simplest to implement, no extra code needed |
| 35 | RLS variable scoping | SET LOCAL within transactions | SET (session-level) | SET LOCAL prevents variable leakage across pooled connections; critical for data isolation |
| 36 | Point impact source of truth | system_settings only | point_categories.point_impact column | Single source prevents drift; admin UI edits system_settings; removed point_impact from point_categories |
| 37 | REDEEM as point category | Removed from seed data | Keep as 4th category | Redemptions use separate `redemptions` table; REDEEM category was never referenced in achievement_points |
| 38 | SECURITY DEFINER search_path | SET search_path = public | No search_path | Prevents schema hijacking; PostgreSQL best practice for SECURITY DEFINER functions |
| 39 | updated_at auto-trigger | Database trigger (fn_set_updated_at) | Application-level via Drizzle | Trigger is foolproof — works for app code, migrations, and manual SQL fixes |
| 40 | Account creation | HR/Admin only (no self-registration) | Self-registration | Internal tool; HR controls who gets access; temp password + force change on first login |
| 41 | Password reset email | Resend (free tier) | No email, SendGrid, SES | Need email for password reset; Resend free tier (100/day) is sufficient; minimal setup; not used for notifications |
| 42 | Self-registration removed | No `/auth/register` endpoint | Allow self-registration | Internal HR tool; all accounts created by HR/Admin; prevents unauthorized access |
| 43 | Backend API integration | Hono embedded in TanStack Start (API wildcard) | Server functions only, separate Hono service | Keep existing Hono middleware chains (auth, RLS, RBAC, uploads) intact; server functions lack streaming uploads + OpenAPI; single container avoids infra complexity. Use server functions selectively for SSR loaders + simple mutations |
| 44 | Client state | Keep Zustand | TanStack Store | TanStack Store is pre-1.0 (v0.9); Zustand is stable with persist middleware; client state is minimal (theme, sidebar) — low impact either way |
| 45 | PWA tooling | Manual (static manifest + Workbox post-build) | vite-plugin-pwa, Serwist | vite-plugin-pwa incompatible with TanStack Start production builds (issue #4988); manual approach is reliable for minimal PWA needs (A2HS + offline indicator) |
| 46 | Build tooling | Vite (bundled with TanStack Start) | Turbopack (Next.js) | Vite is TanStack Start's bundler; Tailwind via `@tailwindcss/vite`; mature plugin ecosystem |
| 47 | Challengeable submissions | Penalti only, by Leaders only | Any submission by anyone | Bintang is positive recognition — no reason to dispute. Poin AHA is direct points — same. Only Penalti (negative) warrants a challenge by a Leader. Penalized employees use Appeal instead. Enforced via RLS policy on challenges table |
| 48 | Locale routing strategy | Cookie-based (no URL prefix) | URL prefix (`/id/dashboard`, `/en/dashboard`) | Internal tool with ~100 users — SEO irrelevant; cookie-based is simpler (no locale segment in every route definition); Paraglide middleware reads `locale_pref` from session → sets cookie → serves correct messages. User switches language via profile dropdown, stored in `users.locale_pref`. |
| 49 | `system_settings` change auditing | Log to `audit_logs` + confirmation modal | No auditing, simple save | Changing impact values retroactively affects all balances. `PATCH /settings/:key` writes old/new values to `audit_logs` (action: `SETTING_CHANGED`). Admin UI shows confirmation modal: "This will affect N employees' Poin AHA balances. Continue?" where N is count of users with relevant active points. |
| 50 | Charting library | Recharts v2 | Chart.js, Nivo, Victory | React-native composable API, lightweight, works well with Tailwind. Needed for Reports Dashboard (line/bar/pie/donut charts). |
| 51 | Notification delivery | Polling (TanStack Query, 30s interval) | SSE, WebSocket | Simplest approach for ~100 users. Unread count query is indexed. SSE/WebSocket adds infra complexity with no user-perceptible benefit at this scale. |
| 52 | Orphaned upload cleanup | Accept orphans (Phase 1); lifecycle rule later | Immediate cleanup job | Storage cost negligible at this scale (~$0.02/GB/month). Add Cloud Storage lifecycle rule via OpenTofu if uploads exceed 1GB. |

### Recently Resolved

| Question | Decision | Date |
|----------|----------|------|
| How are `system_settings` changes audited? | **Log to `audit_logs`** — `PATCH /settings/:key` writes old/new values (action: `SETTING_CHANGED`); admin UI shows confirmation modal with affected employee count (Decision #49) | 2026-03-27 |
| Locale routing strategy | **Cookie-based, no URL prefix** — internal tool, SEO irrelevant; Paraglide reads `locale_pref` from session (Decision #48) | 2026-03-27 |
| Charting library | **Recharts v2** — React-native, composable, lightweight (Decision #50) | 2026-03-27 |
| Notification delivery mechanism | **Polling (30s via TanStack Query)** — simplest for ~100 users (Decision #51) | 2026-03-27 |
| Orphaned upload cleanup | **Accept orphans in Phase 1** — add lifecycle rule later if storage exceeds 1GB (Decision #52) | 2026-03-27 |
| What happens to pending submissions when a Leader leaves? | **Escalate to HR** — HR already has branch-wide approval permissions; simplest to implement (Decision #34) | 2026-03-27 |
| File upload architecture | **Signed URLs** — 5MB max, JPEG/PNG/WebP, private bucket, 15-min read URLs, client-side resize to 1920px | 2026-03-25 |
| Session timeout | **7-day sliding window** — refresh daily on activity, re-auth after 7 days inactive | 2026-03-25 |
| Employee team change | **Points stay with employee** — points are user-scoped, not team-scoped; no data migration needed on team change | 2026-03-25 |
| Branch-specific rewards | **Yes (nullable branch_id)** — `rewards.branch_id` added, NULL = global reward available to all branches | 2026-03-25 |
| Redemption notes field | **Added** — `redemptions.notes` column for keterangan (e.g., size for kaos/seragam) | 2026-03-25 |
| Admin redemption access | **Yes** — Admin can request redemptions (full system access) | 2026-03-25 |
| RLS session variable safety | **SET LOCAL** — must use `SET LOCAL` within transactions to prevent variable leakage across pooled connections | 2026-03-25 |
| Production database tier | **db-f1-micro** — sufficient for ~100 users, lowest cost; upgrade if needed | 2026-03-25 |
| Point impact retroactivity | **Retroactive** — changing +10 to +15 affects all historical balances (simpler calculation via system_settings at query time) | 2026-03-24 |
| Reward catalog i18n | **No** — rewards data comes from Google Sheets; Thailand branch features not yet established | 2026-03-24 |
| Leader self-submission | **No** — leaders cannot give themselves points. Leader A can give Leader B. HR can give anyone. | 2026-03-24 |
| Multiple challengers | **Yes** — multiple people can challenge the same submission; HR resolves once for all | 2026-03-24 |
| Notification retention | **90 days** — auto-delete read notifications after 90 days | 2026-03-24 |
